The Objective of the game is select the deck of cards you want to\n          play\n          with and then face off against an opposing deck. Each card has a health value, defense value, and attack\n          value.\n          When attacking another card your attack points are subtracted by the opposing card's defense value, then\n          their\n          health is subtracted from your remaining attack points and vice versa. Additionally you can only see the\n          back\n          of the opponent's cards until you attack those respective cards. Each deck will have ten cards and the\n          first\n          one to run out loses.
